  - Types of Algorithm(s)
    1) Advanced Encryption Standard = aes
    2) Data Encryption Standard = des (Designed to encrypt / decrypt utilizing 8-byte blocks and 64-bit key)
    3) Blowfish = bf (Utilizes variable size key and is a block cipher which operates with 64-bit of data)
  - Types of Mode(s)
    1) Electronic Code Book = ecb
    2) Cipher Block Chaining = cbc
    3) Cipher Feedback = cfb

  - A technique that deceives victims from malicious requests by inheriting the identity and certain privileges to perform a certain output on the victim‚Äôs behalf. Users‚Äô session cookie, IP address, window domain credentials are ways websites identify the specific credentials associated with
    the website. When users‚Äô credentials are authenticated to that website, they cannot distinguish between the forged request and a legitimate request where the threat actor can perform certain functions.
- <b> Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab </b>
  - [Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Buffer-Overflow-Attack-Lab)
  - Simulated buffer overflow attack lab.
