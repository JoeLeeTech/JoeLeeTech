  - Types of Algorithm(s)
    1) Advanced Encryption Standard = aes
    2) Data Encryption Standard = des (Designed to encrypt / decrypt utilizing 8-byte blocks and 64-bit key)
    3) Blowfish = bf (Utilizes variable size key and is a block cipher which operates with 64-bit of data)
  - Types of Mode(s)
    1) Electronic Code Book = ecb
    2) Cipher Block Chaining = cbc
    3) Cipher Feedback = cfb
    4) Output Feedback = ofb
- <b> SQL Injection (SQLi) Lab </b>
  - [SQL Injection (SQLi Lab)](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/SQL-Injection-SQLi-Lab)
  - Explored SQL injection vulnerabilities by exploiting a web application designed with common developer mistakes. Demonstrated the impact of SQL injection attacks and implemented techniques to defend against them. Topics covered include SQL SELECT and UPDATE statements, SQL injection methods, and the use of prepared statements to enhance security. 
- <b> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack </b>
  - [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack Lab ](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-Attack-Lab)
  - Conducted a CSRF attack on the Elgg social networking web application to understand and exploit CSRF vulnerabilities. Implemented and tested countermeasures including secret tokens and same-site cookies. Gained experience with HTTP GET and POST requests, JavaScript, and Ajax to enhance web application security.
- <b> Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab </b>
  - [Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Buffer-Overflow-Attack-Lab)
  - Exploited buffer overflow vulnerabilities to gain root privileges and alter program control flow. Analyzed and evaluated protection mechanisms like address randomization, non-executable stacks, and StackGuard. Topics covered included stack layout, shellcode, and buffer overflow mitigation techniques.
