<h2>üîê Cybersecurity Labs:</h2>

- <b> Cryptography Lab (Secret Key Encryption) </b>
  - [Cryptography Lab (Secret Key Encryption)](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Cryptography-Lab-Secret-Key-Encryption-)
  - Types of Algorithm(s)
    1) Advanced Encryption Standard = aes
    2) Data Encryption Standard = des (Designed to encrypt / decrypt utilizing 8-byte blocks and 64-bit key)
    3) Blowfish = bf (Utilizes variable size key and is a block cipher which operates with 64-bit of data)
  - Types of Mode(s)
    1) Electronic Code Book = ecb
    2) Cipher Block Chaining = cbc
    3) Cipher Feedback = cfb
    4) Output Feedback = ofb
- <b> SQL Injection (SQLi) Lab </b>
  - [SQL Injection (SQLi Lab)](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/SQL-Injection-SQLi-Lab)
  - SQL injection is a technique that inserts a string of text(s) to send certain commands that communicate with the backend database to exploit sensitive data from the database, modify database data, and / or gain administrative privileges at the root. This can be done through the user
    interface as well as through the terminal.
- <b> Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack </b>
  - [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack Lab ](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-Attack-Lab)
  - A technique that deceives victims from malicious requests by inheriting the identity and certain privileges to perform a certain output on the victim‚Äôs behalf. Users‚Äô session cookie, IP address, window domain credentials are ways websites identify the specific credentials associated with
    the website. When users‚Äô credentials are authenticated to that website, they cannot distinguish between the forged request and a legitimate request where the threat actor can perform certain functions.
- <b> Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab </b>
  - [Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Buffer-Overflow-Attack-Lab)
  - Simulated buffer overflow attack lab.
    
- <b>NMAP Lab </b>
- <b>Wireshark</b>
- <b>Credential Harvester</b>
- <b>Password Hashing</b>
- <b> Dark Web - Tor Browser</b>
- <b>Windows Security Log</b>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Projects:</h2>

  - <b>Identity Access Management (IAM) Website - Role Based Access Control</b>
    - [Identity Access Management (IAM) Website - Role Based Access Control](https://github.com/JoeLeeTech/Identity-Access-Management-IAM-Website-Role-Based-Access-Control)
    - Technology Stack: ASP.NET, C#, Microsoft Azure, and SQL Server
